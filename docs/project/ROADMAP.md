# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines upcoming milestones for `count_lines`.

- **Short term:** flesh out integration tests and formatter coverage.
- **Mid term:** introduce persistence abstractions for alternate storage backends.
- **Long term:** explore feature-specific modules (e.g., Git integration) behind crate features.
