# Actually strict no_std regex might be tricky. regex-automata is lower level. 
# But let's try regex with default-features=false. 'std' feature is usually enabled for Error impls etc.
# Ideally we want NO std. 
# "regex" crate with `default-features = false` and `features = ["perf"]` uses `alloc` but not `std`.
